Parallel Reduction:
Theory:
Parallel Reduction is a technique used in parallel computing to perform associative operations, such as addition, multiplication, minimum, maximum, etc., in a parallel manner. It involves dividing the data into smaller chunks, performing the operation on each chunk independently, and then combining the results to obtain the final output.

Implementation:
Parallel Min Operation:
Divide the array into smaller chunks.
Each thread finds the minimum value in its chunk.
Combine the minimum values from each chunk to find the overall minimum.
Parallel Max Operation:
Similar to the Min operation but finds the maximum value.
Parallel Sum Operation:
Divide the array into smaller chunks.
Each thread calculates the sum of elements in its chunk.
Combine the partial sums from each chunk to find the total sum.
Parallel Average Operation:
Calculate the sum of all elements in parallel.
Divide the sum by the total number of elements to find the average.
Performance Measurement:
Measure the execution time of parallel reduction operations.
Compare the performance with sequential reduction operations to assess speedup.
Evaluate the scalability of the parallel implementation concerning the number of processor cores.
